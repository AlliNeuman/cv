    <h1>About</h1>
    <div class="more-about">
      <p>My Name is Allison, but I am known as Alli to all, and to many as Alli Neu.</p>
      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>I am passionate about building user-friendly and engaging projects. I am ready to take on new challenges and create successful and meaningful work for clients. My full-stack bootcamp and work experience have provided a diverse tech background encompasing Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Python, PHP and React. My career has not been a traditional path in tech, but I do believe it makes me a stronger, well-rounded, outgoing developer.</p>
      <p>My roots started in teaching high school Math where I learned to work and collaborate with colleagues, administrators and parents for the better of the children. I moved into the finance field where I worked in the commercial and residential lending for 7 years and a wide variety of positions ranging from advising, production management, marketing content planning and management for a mortgage team.
      </p>
      <p>I am seeking a full-time web developer role that provides an opportunity to grow, learn and evolve as a developer. With my strong skills in team building, project management, analytics and creative design I can support small and large businesses to drive productivity and improve connections with their consumers.</p>
      <h4>Hobbies</h4>
      <p>Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, yoga, playing piano and doing DIY projects. I strive to recognize the little things in life, and take my time to go the extra step in making anything I work on beautiful, whether it is in work, plating my food, or my art/DIY projects. I strongly believe there is something to be said about anything aesthetically pleasing and the extra time and care is always worth the effort.</p>
